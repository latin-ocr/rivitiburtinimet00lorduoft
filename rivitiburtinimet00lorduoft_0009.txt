PREFACE.

lx this little volume will be found all the metres of
Horace’s odes except two, which are represented each by a
single ode not suitable for singing.

The chief thought in the work has been to promote correct
rhythm in reading the odes, to add to the ease and pleasure
of committing them, and to ensure them a more permanent
place in the meiuory, all of which the charm of appropriate
music ought to accomplish.

The melodies have been selected and adapted from
Beethoven‚ Schubert, Henselt, Emery, and others.

The music has been fitted to the first couplet, stanza, or
strophes‚ so that slight modifications are sometimes necessary
later on in the ode‚—such as the substitution of two short
syllables for one long one where a dactyl takes the place of a
spondee, or, at the end of a verse, for a long note a note and
rest of half its value. In singing due attention must be paid
to the holds, and the learner should be especially careful not
to give the long sound to a short vowel where length of time
is merely the result of position.

The arrangement is designedly that of one-part songs, to be
sung in unison by however many voices, the harmony being

wholly in the accompaniment.
